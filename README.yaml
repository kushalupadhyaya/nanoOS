# Design Documentation for Nanokernel-RS

## Architecture

The nanokernel follows a modular design:
- **Scheduler:** Manages task switching in a simplified round-robin style.
- **Interrupts:** Provides very basic interrupt handling.
- **IPC:** Implements placeholder message passing between modules.
- **Power Management:** Contains stubs for power-related operations.
- **Architecture Layer:** Abstracts hardware-specific initialization and configuration.
- **Drivers:** Minimal drivers for timer, UART, and GPIO to interact with hardware.

## Design Considerations

- **Memory Footprint:** The project is `no_std` and aims for a final binary size of 50–150 KB.
- **Safety:** Rust’s features are leveraged for safety while keeping performance optimal.
- **Modularity:** Each component is separated into its own module for clarity and ease of maintenance.
